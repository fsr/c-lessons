\section{File descriptors}
\subsection{}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Describing a file}
	The basic way to handle files in C is to use the interface with your operating system on a very low level.\\
	Each process has its own set of \textbf{file descriptors} - arbitrary integer numbers that represent a file.\\ \bigskip
	To open a file and get a descriptor use the system call function \textit{open()}:\\

	\begin{lstlisting}
int myfile = open("savestate", O_RDWR);
\end{lstlisting}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item See \textit{man 2 open} for further information and library includes concerning this function.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Write and read}
	For actually putting data into a file, there is the function \textit{write()}.\\
	It takes a file descriptor, the input string and the amount of bytes to be written:\bigskip
	
	\begin{lstlisting}
int myfile = open("savestate", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);
char *mytext = "foo";
write(myfile, mytext, 4);
\end{lstlisting}\ \\\ \\

	To read data from a file, you have to prepare a variable to put it in:\\\ \\
	
	\begin{lstlisting}
int myfile = open("savestate", O_RDONLY);
char mytext[256] = {0};
read(myfile, mytext, sizeof mytext - 1);
\end{lstlisting}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Close}
	After finishing your file operations, you have to tell your OS that you have do not need the file any more by closing the file descriptor:\\\ \\
	
	\begin{lstlisting}
int myfile = open("savestate", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);
char *mytext = "foo";
write(myfile, mytext, 4);
close(myfile);
\end{lstlisting}\bigskip
	Note that there is a maximum number of files a process can have opened at a time!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Special file descriptors}
	By default, each process has the three file descriptors \textit{0, 1 and 2} referring to the standard input, output and error.\\
	You could read user input and write output by using the \textit{read()} and \textit{write()} functions along with these files as well:\bigskip
	\begin{lstlisting}
char message[32] = "Hello ";
write(1, "Enter your name:\n", 18);
read(0, message + 6, 24);
strcpy(message + strlen(message) - 1, "!\n");
write(1, message, strlen(message));
\end{lstlisting}\bigskip
	
	To avoid these random numbers in your code, use the constants defined in \textit{unistd.h}: \textit{STDIN\_FILENO}, \textit{STDOUT\_FILENO}, \textit{STDERR\_FILENO}.

\end{frame}

\section{File pointers}
\subsection{}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Returning to standard}
	The C standard library contains a special datastructure for handling files: a so called \textbf{file pointer} \textit{FILE*}:\\\ \\
	
	\begin{lstlisting}
FILE *myfile = fopen("savestate", "r+");
char content[256] = {0};
fgets(content, sizeof content - 1, myfile);
fputs("foo", myfile);
fclose(myfile);
\end{lstlisting}\bigskip

	\begin{itemize}
		\item These and more handy functions are declared in \textit{stdio.h}
		\item See the man page for further information.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Making life easier}
	By browsing \textit{stdio.h}, you will find the following function:
	\begin{lstlisting}
int fprintf(FILE *restrict, const char *restrict, ...);
\end{lstlisting}
	\textit{fprintf()} behaves exactly as \textit{printf()}, except that you can write to any file passed as the first argument.\\ \bigskip
	There are also special file pointers declared for standard input, output and error:
	\textit{stdin}, \textit{stdout} and \textit{stderr}.\\ \bigskip
	In fact, it is good practice to read user input with \textit{fgets()} since you can pass the size of your buffer avoiding dangerous \textbf{buffer overflows}:
	\begin{lstlisting}
fgets(buffer, sizeof buffer - 1, stdin);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\section{Dungeon}
\subsection{}
\begin{frame}{Savestates}
	Now that you are common with file management, implement a savestate functionality into the dungeon.\\\ \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When the game quits (by pressing \textit{x}) the game data should be written into a savestate.
		\item If there is a savestate, the game should load it on start.
		\item There also should be an opportunity to exit the game without saving.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
